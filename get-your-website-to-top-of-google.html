        <h1>How to Get your Website to the Top of Google</h1>

        <div class="published">Published on Oct 25th 2017 By Josef</div

<p>Do you want to learn how to get your website to the top of Google?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably what every business owner wants. Five years ago you could just hire an SEO company and they would do their magic and get your website there in few weeks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not that easy anymore.</p>
<p>Google is getting smarter every year. Their sophisticated algorithms are getting more complicated and simple methods to trick them don&rsquo;t work anymore.</p>
<p>Using of the old methods to trick Google might result in punishing your website and moving to much worse position or even removing it from the Google results completely.</p>

<h2>Google Want to Bring The Visitors The Best Results</h2>

<p>Why does Google make such a big deal of proper ranking websites? It&rsquo;s simple &ndash; it&rsquo;s all about money (what a surprise).</p>
<p>Google is a business and their main goal is to make a profit on advertising.</p>
<p>When you search on Google they want to make sure that you get the best results so you continue to use their service.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they put so much effort in ranking websites correctly. They want to make sure that you get the best results possible.</p>
<p>For example if you search for &ldquo;landscaping asheville&rdquo; on Google they want to give you the best results for this keywords.</p>
<p>They want to make sure that the links on the first page will be highly relevant to you search term.</p>
<p>The first page of the Google results for this term will be dominated by landscaping companies which have been around for a while and have great review and reputation.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to include a website of a landscaping company which just starting out and have no reviews.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s Easier to Get on The First Page if You Live in a small town</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in a small town and just started a business it&rsquo;ll be much easier to get your website to the first page than if you live in a big city.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you live in a small town (Sylva, North Carolina) and you just started well drilling business.</p>
<p>There are couple other people who offer the same services but they&rsquo;re old folks and have no websites. They get all work from their referrals.</p>
<p>Then it would be easy to get you website to the first page of Google because there is no competition. There are no other websites competing for the positions on the first page.</p>
<p>Every time someone goes to Google and searches for &ldquo;well drilling sylva nc&rdquo; your website will appear in the results on the first page.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s Hard to Get on The First Page If You Live in a Big City</h2>

<p>On the other hand let&rsquo;s say you live in Chicago and you just started computer repair service. Then it&rsquo;ll be extremely hard to get a good position on Google.</p>
<p>There are literally thousands of business which offer the same service. They have been around for years and have ton of review on their Google Business pages, have large following on their Facebook Page and others.</p>
<h2>The Most Relevant Goes to The First Page</h2>
<p>There are many different factors which Google uses to rank websites. Their algorithms look at these and many other things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Does Your Website Load Fast?</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Google wants the best experience for their users. They prefer quick loading websites over slow websites.</li>
<li><strong>Does Your Website Have Relevant Helpful Content?</strong> &ndash; based on the time the visitors spend on your website Google can determine if your content is helpful for the visitor. If someone comes to your website and leaves right away for Google it&rsquo;s a sign that you&rsquo;re website is not that interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Regularly Updated Content</strong> &ndash; Google loves fresh regularly updated content. Creating a blog on your website and post regularly is one the methods how to make Google (and your visitors) like your website. Write helpful articles full of value and great tips.</li>
<li><strong>Social Networks</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Google checks if you&rsquo;re active on social networks and how your following and engagement.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were some of the things Google takes into account when calculation the position of your website compared to websites of your competition.</p>

<h2>Optimize Your Website For Search Engines (SEO)</h2>

<p>On Page Search Engine optimization is set of rules which help search engine to decide what is your website about. For example if you own a cleaning service in Asheville you need to these keywords in your title on your first page.</p>
<p>This will help Google to determine that you offer cleaning service and you&rsquo;re located in Asheville.</p>
<p>When someone searches for &ldquo;cleaning service Asheville&rdquo; then Google shows your website in the results (including other websites of cleaning services in Asheville).</p>

<h2>It Takes Time And Patience</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you just started a landscaping company. You&nbsp;got you website built.&nbsp;When you search for landscaping companies on Google in your area you&rsquo;ll find your website on 5th page of Google results.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at closely.</p>
<p>If you take closer look at the websites on the first page you&rsquo;ll find out that these companies have been around for years. They have a ton of reviews on their Google Business profile. They have blogs with countless articles, they social networks with large followings.</p>
<p>Honestly at this point you can&rsquo;t compete with these websites. They large online presence which they gathered over the years being in business.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect Google to assign the same relevance to your new just built website&nbsp;as websites which years old and have large following on social networks.</p>

<h2>Be Honest, Patient and Helpful</h2>

<p>When you build your website and it&rsquo;s new you can&rsquo;t expect Google to put in on the first page of Google next to the other landscaping companies who have been around for years.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to trick Google and trick their algorithm to move you website higher. I&rsquo;ll most probably result in more harm than benefit.</p>
<p>You need to slowly but steadily work on your business, your website, your reputation. It&rsquo;ll be slow process but over time you&rsquo;ll earn your reputation and you&rsquo;ll deserve to move to the better position on Google.</p>

<h2>Use Other Methods of How to Get Clients</h2>

<p>If you just started your website it probably won&rsquo;t bring you any sales or clients at this point (unless you like in small town with little competition).</p>
<p>You need to use another methods how to bring work to your business. This is list of several of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook Page and Facebook ads</li>
<li>Google Ads</li>
<li>Advertising in Craigslist (the &ldquo;services&rdquo; category)</li>
<li>Connect with other local businesses and offer them your services</li>
<li>Ads in local newspaper</li>
<li>Posters, Banners</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making Your Website Successful is a Long Term Process</h2>

<p>Every time you finish a project ask you client to write you a review on your Google Business page. I&rsquo;ll make you business look more trustworthy.</p>
<p>Also work on getting more followers on your Facebook page.</p>
<p>It depends on the type of business you&rsquo;re running but having a blog on your website is another great idea. Write helpful articles full of value and you&rsquo;ll bring people who searching for solutions to their problems from Google.</p>
<p>All of these things require a long term commitment and effort but if you stay focused and consistent with your work you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with website which will deserve to be on the first page of the results and Google will be happy to include your website in the results.</p>
