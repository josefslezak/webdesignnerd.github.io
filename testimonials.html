            <h2>Patrick Casale, Asheville<h2>    

            <p>Patrick Casale is an Asheville based counselor specializing in addiction and recovery and co-occuring disorders. His old website was outdated and slow so he wanted to build a new one. I used a modern and fresh looking theme with large image in the header. The website is built using WordPress content management system so Patrick can update the content by himself. You can see the website I created for him at <a href="http://resilientmindcounseling.com" target="_BLANK">resilientmindcounseling.com</a>.</p>

            <h3>Patrick's Testimonial:</h3>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"Josef was very helpful, creating a new website for me.  I'm a counselor in Asheville and wanted to make my website more accessible.  Josef was knowledgeable and answered all of my many questions.  After the site was complete, I can't tell you how many times he answered my "final request."  I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for quality, affordable web development."</p>

            <h2>Justin Blackburn, Asheville<h2>    

            <p>At the beginning of 2017 Justin started his dream project - a recovery house in Asheville. I built a website to present his services. You can see the finished website at <a href="http://thehomecenterformen.com" target="_BLANK">thehomecenterformen.com</a>.</p>

            <h3>Justin's Testimonial:</h3>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"My name is Justin Blackburn and I recently opened a recovery house in Asheville North Carolina! Obviously, in order to get our name and purpose out to the public, I began seeking options both on social media and a home webpage for people who wanted to get information about us! If I'm not mistaken I made a public post on Facebook and Josef responded!! He was very glad to help and not only did he satisfy any wishes that I've had, he also provided his expertise and recommendations to ensure the quality and efficiency of the site!!!"</p>

                <p>"I have absolutely NO idea what I'm doing and Josef has guided me step-by-step through this process. He's been a great help and has done an excellent job putting my purpose and dreams into something concrete and able to be seen!!! I don't know if this is a bad thing, but Josef was able to do all of this and we have never met face-to-face due to conflicting schedules!!! Please check out his work and give Josef a call if you're looking for the professional and quality touch that YOUR dreams deserve!!!"</p>

            <h2>Timothy Maguire, Asheville<h2>    
 
            <p>Timothy Maguire is a NYC chef who moved to Asheville to get away from the busy life in New York City. Timothy asked me to speed up his cooking blog at <a href="http://timothymaguire.com" target="_BLANK">timothymaguire.com</a>. Loading time of the WordPress blog was around 4 seconds which was too long. I unistalled some of the plugins and optimized the front page to load the images faster.</p>

            <h3>Timothy's Testimonial:</h3>
        
            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>"My web site really suffered for months from previous web designers. Lack of experience and ability to project the message I was trying to put out to the World. I met Josef and we hit it off straight away. As opposed to previous web designers that believed their ideas were better then what I, the customer, simply requested. Josef gave me exactly what I asked for. Since then I have gotten tremendous exposure to the internet World even getting contacted by a Food Channel thats now interested in promoting my brand. Forever grateful. Many thanks to Josef"</p>
