			<h2>7 Thing You Need to Know Before You Hire a Website Designer</h2>


			<div class="subsection1">
			<p>Website without Traffic doesn't bring you any business. Your website is like a store in an abandoned part of the town. You can make it look great but if you don't bring customers then you won't make any sales. How can you bring visitors to your website? You need to promote it. Use local business business directories, search engine optimization, your business Facebook page or create an email list.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="space">.</div>

			<div class="subsection2">
			<p>Outdated old looking website will most likely turn off your visitors. Your website is a reflection of your business. Make it look fresh and modern. Make sure all parts of your website work properly. Make sure your website shows correctly on smartphones and tablets. Make it as easy as possible for your customers to learn about your services and products, contact you and make a purchase. </p>
			</div>


			<div class="clear"></div>





			<div class="subsection1">
			<p>You can't simply pay Google to put your website on the first page of the Google results. Order of the webites in Google results is based on many factors. Google wants to makes sure that the websites on teh first page are the highest quality ones. How does Google measure quality of a website? They look at the overall presence of the business on the Internet. They look at the reviews of the customers, how old is the website? Is the business an authority in the area? How long do visitors stay on the website? And many others.</p>

			<div class="subsection2">
						<p>You can't rank your website for all the keywords on Google. More broad keywords you are trying to target, tougher is the competition. More other websites are competing for the same keywords. For example if you run a landscaping company in Sylva, NC you get much less competition that if you run it in Raleigh, NC. Similarly there will much more companies competing in Google results.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="clear"></div>





			<div class="subsection1">
			<p>You get what you pay for. There are lot of people who can build your website for $200 or $300. And that's fine If you want just a simple website so you can put the link on your business card. However if you want your website to generate new clients, customers and leads be prepared to pay at least $1000. Your website is only one part of the equation. See the steps below to learn how you can maje your website work for your business. </p>

				<div class="testimonial">
				
				<h2>Justin Blackburn, Asheville</h2>
				<p>"My name is Justin Blackburn and I recently opened a recovery house in Asheville North Carolina! Obviously, in order to get our name and purpose out to the public, I began seeking options both on social media and a home webpage for people who wanted to get information about us! If I'm not mistaken I made a public post on Facebook and Josef responded!! He was very glad to help and not only did he satisfy any wishes that I've had, he also provided his expertise and recommendations to ensure the quality and efficiency of the site!!!"

"I have absolutely NO idea what I'm doing and Josef has guided me step-by-step through this process. He's been a great help and has done an excellent job putting my purpose and dreams into something concrete and able to be seen!!! I don't know if this is a bad thing, but Josef was able to do all of this and we have never met face-to-face due to conflicting schedules!!! Please check out his work and give Josef a call if you're looking for the professional and quality touch that YOUR dreams deserve!!!"</p>
				</div>



				<div class="testimonial">
				<p>"My web site really suffered for months from previous web designers. Lack of experience and ability to project the message I was trying to put out to the World. I met Josef and we hit it off straight away. As opposed to previous web designers that believed their ideas were better then what I, the customer, simply requested. Josef gave me exactly what I asked for. Since then I have gotten tremendous exposure to the internet World even getting contacted by a Food Channel thats now interested in promoting my brand. Forever grateful. Many thanks to Josef"</p>

				<h2>What's is The Price?</h2>

			<p>My price for basic website starts at $750. I've built $300 websites in past but I realized that I can't put as much time into the development as I wanted to and therefore can't build the websites as good it could be. Building a good quality website takes time. So your website can benefit from it. 

Your website is not an expense. It's an investment to your business which makes you more money in the long run.
