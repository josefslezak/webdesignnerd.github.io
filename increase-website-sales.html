        <h1>How to Increase Sales on Your Website: Review of Pcangelnow.com</h1>

        <div class="published">Published on Oct 27th 2017 By Josef</div

<p>For some time I&rsquo;ve been posting ads to Craigslist to the &ldquo;services/computer&rdquo; category. I offer a no-charge check of websites. I&rsquo;ll find ways how to increase sales on your website.</p>
<p>I look at the website and the social media and I&rsquo;ll try to suggest ideas how to make things better.&nbsp;I got contacted by Mike from&nbsp;<a href="http://pcangelnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pcangelnow.com</a> who was interested in checking of his website.</p>

<div class="image-med">
   <img src="images/pcangelnow.com-review-of-the-website.jpg" alt="pcangelnow.com review of the website">
</div>

<h2>Cheesy Banner on Top</h2>
<p>When I looked at the website at desktop the first thing which hit my eyes was the banner on top. To be honest I don&rsquo;t like cheesy marketing stock images. It looks too generic and it makes me feel like the website is a scam.</p>
<p>However I understand that it might work for some people. This is actually very interested area of marketing. There are probably studies out there which focus on this.</p>
<p>It all boils down to which kind of people you want to target with your business. I&rsquo;ve never trusted the cheesy images like that but there must be a reason why these are still around. It probably works for some people.</p>
<p>When I talked to Mike on the phone he agrees that the banner looks cheesy and he&rsquo;s thinking about replacing it with something else.</p>
<h2>Too Many Products</h2>
<p>The website offers 8 different packages. I think it&rsquo;s too many. It might be confusing for the visitors. They might choose to not to pick any of them because they don&rsquo;t want to put the effort in figuring out which suits them best.</p>


<div class="image-med">
   <img src="images/pcangelnow.com-website-review-too-many-products.jpg" alt="pcangelnow.com website review too many products">
</div>



<p>I would create only three main packages which are the most popular ones (from the past experience) and make them visually the main thing on the website. The less popular packages can be placed below.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only my opinion &ndash; an idea to try and test for example with <a href="http://hotjar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotjar.com</a>&nbsp;which is a great tool for testing and tracking.</p>
<p>I would create a test page with only few products and than watch behavior of the visitors.</p>
<p>Hotjar&nbsp; records behavior of every visitor on the website and then you can play a video where you can see what they&rsquo;re doing &ndash; how they scroll pages, what they click on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great tool for gaining more insights about behavior of the visitors on your website.</p>
<h2>The Design Looks Outdated</h2>
<p>The design of the website could use more bright colors. To me the blacks and grays don&rsquo;t feel so inviting.</p>
<p>I think more fresh colors would help the website to look more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h2>Add a Photo on About Us Page</h2>
<p>Mike could share more details about his experience and his story on his &ldquo;About Us&rdquo; page.</p>
<p>Also I think if he puts his picture on the page it would help to bring more trustworthiness to the website.</p>
<p>People could relate much more to a real person with a story and picture than to an antonymous website somewhere on the internet.</p>
<h2>Confusing Services Page</h2>
<p>The graphic design of the packages should look the same as it is on the first (home page) page. I know this only a minor thing but I&rsquo;m trying to write everything I see what could be done better.</p>


<div class="image-med">
   <img src="images/pcangelnow.com-website-review-confusing-services-page.jpg" alt="pcangelnow.com website review confusing services page">
</div>


<h2>Outdated Blog</h2>
<p>Last blog post was written on June 5, 2015, that&rsquo;s more than two years ago.</p>
<p>I understand that writing&nbsp; regularly blog posts requires a lot of time and effort but it can reward you with free traffic from Google which is worth of the struggle.</p>
<p>Also the blog posts on Mike&rsquo;s website are very short. They should be at least 600 words long and they should be focused on bringing great value and tips to the visitors.</p>
<h2>Website Doesn&rsquo;t Show Properly on Mobile</h2>
<p>The banner on top and the text at bottom are not aligned in the middle. Also some parts of the website are grey text on black background which is very hard to read.</p>


<div class="image-med">
   <img src="images/pcangelnow.com-website-review-mobile-optimization-doesnt-work.jpg" alt="pcangelnow.com website review mobile optimization doesnt work">
</div>


<h2>On Page SEO Optimization</h2>
<p>When I look at the source code of the website I can check the on page SEO optimization.</p>
<p>The title tag:&nbsp;<span class="html-tag">&lt;title&gt;</span>PC Angel Now! &ndash; Virus Removal, PC Problems Solved<span class="html-tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="html-tag">The title tag should include something like &ldquo;computer repair service&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the main search term people are going to use when searching someone to fix their computer.</span></p>
<p>Virus Removal keyword is one of the services Mike offers but it&rsquo;s not the main one so it shouldn&rsquo;t be in the title.</p>
<p>Tags &ldquo;meta description&rdquo; and &ldquo;H1&rdquo; are missing on the page completely. These are the main on page SEO tags which help Google to determine what is the website about.</p>
<h2>Dogs And Cats on The Facebook Page</h2>
<p>Most of the posts on Mike&rsquo;s Facebook Page are pictures of cats and dogs. When I talked to Mike he said he admits that he&rsquo;s a big dog and cats lover.</p>


<div class="image-med">
   <img src="images/pcangelnow.com-facebook-page-cats-and-dogs.jpg" alt="pcangelnow.com facebook page cats and dogs">
</div>


<p>I think the posts on his Facebook page should be more focused on computers. It should be helpful tips on how to use your computer better or how to fix simple problems by yourself.</p>
<h2>Missing Reviews on The Google Business Page</h2>
<p>Reviews on Google Business page is a great and easy way how to gain more trustworthiness&nbsp; on the internet. After every finished job he can ask the client to write him an review.</p>
<p>This way he can get a lot reviews pretty fast.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think the tips I presented above could help Mike and his business to achieve more traffic from Google (on page SEO and blog) and help to turn more visitors into clients (redesign of the look of the website).</p>
<p>We had a long talk with Mike about the tips and hopefully some of the changes will help to get him more clients.</p>
