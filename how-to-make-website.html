        <h1>How to Make a Website: Can You Do it By Yourself?</h1>

        <div class="published">Published on Oct 22nd 2017 By Josef</div

<p>Let me tell you my story how I started with web design. How I got from &ldquo;I can do it all by myself&rdquo; to &ldquo;dammit, maybe it&rsquo;s not so easy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I started with building websites in 2012. I always enjoyed programming and also I like graphics and playing in Photoshop. I decided to try to make some money on the side by web design.</p>
<p>I finished few websites for my clients and friends and everything looked promising.</p>
<p>I had all these plans like I&rsquo;m gonna scale it up and build websites full time but then my bright future slowly began to disappear.</p>
<p>My clients started contacting me and they all had the same problem &ndash; they didn&rsquo;t get any clients from their websites.</p>
<p>I felt bad because they payed me for building of their website but they didn&rsquo;t get anything from that.</p>
<p>I started realizing that maybe web design is not that ease as I thought.</p>
<p>When trying to solve the problem I installed Google Analytics to their websites and found that there are no visitors coming to the websites.</p>

<div class="image-med">
    <img src="images/google-analytics-no-visitors.png" alt="google analytics no visitors">
</div>


<p>And that’s how I learned about the main challenge of every website owner – how to get visitors to the website.</p>

<h2>How to Get Visitors to Your Website</h2>

<p>There are many ways how you can get visitors to your website. Some of the most used ones are these:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Blogging</b> – writing SEO optimized articles on your website</li>
    <li><b>Social media</b> – Facebook Page, Google Business, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Payed advertising</b> – Google AdWords, Facebook ads, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Email list</b> – sending news letters to your potential clients</li>
</ul>

<p>So your did a lot of Googling and learning and you found a way how to bring visitors to your website.</p>

<p>You can see in your Google Analytics that you’re getting visitors but still you don’t make any sales  and no clients call you.</p>

<p>You’re telling yourself : “Dammit, what’s wrong now”?</p>

<p>And you just learned about another challenge of web design which is copy writing – how to write a text on your website which makes your visitors buy your products or order your services.</p>

<h2>How to Makes Your Visitors Buy Your Products And Services</h2>

<p>There have been done a lot of research on finding out how to write a website copy which turns visitors into buyers and there have been written a lot of books about it.</p>
<p>Website copy writing is based on studying of psychology of the web users and trying to figure out what your clients actually want and how to write text which appeals to them.</p>
<p>I recommend great book on website copy writing: Web Copy That Sells by Maria Veloso. It&rsquo;s full of interesting tips and insights.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s assume you have visitors to your website and you have written a good copy but you still don&rsquo;t see any sales?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem now?</p>
<p>Then I recommend to check your product.</p>


<h2>Is Your Product or Service Good Enough?</h2>

<p>Do people actually want or need your product or service? Is the price you&rsquo;re asking too high? What about your competition? Do they offer similar or better products for better price?</p>
<p>What are the pains and problems you&rsquo;re trying to solve for you clients or customers? Can you improve your product and give them more value?</p>
<p>More you know about your clients and customers better you&rsquo;ll be able to help them. And if you can help them then they&rsquo;ll be willing to pay you.</p>

<h2>Measure, Test, Track</h2>

<p>Today there are lot available tools which you can use for measuring, testing and tracking.</p>
<p>It can bring you valuable information about what your visitors do on your website and it can help you to find possible problems.</p>
<p>The most used one is Google Analytics which can give you basic information about visitors of your website.</p>
<p>Another great tool is Hotjar (hotjar.com) which allows you to see where on your website your visitors click and how they scroll the pages on your website.</p>

<div class="image-med">
    <img src="images/hotjar-website-heat-map.jpg" alt="hotjar website heat map">
</div>

<p>You can even play videos which shows you what the visitors do on your website. It’s pretty amazing tool and it helps you to gain more insights about behavior of the visitors on your website.</p>

<h2>So Should You Build It By Yourself or Not?</h2>


<p>Purpose of your website is to bring clients to your business. And that&rsquo;s much more difficult to achieve than just building a pretty website.</p>
<p>There are many great tools available today which makes building your website really easy and without needing to learn coding (Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, Shopify, WordPress).</p>
<p>Wix and Squarespace makes web design look really easy in their commercials and it&rsquo;s true in some way.&nbsp;You can build a nice looking website very easily.</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t tell you that then you need to bring visitors to your website, write a good copy, learn how to track and test what your visitors do on your website and other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you from building your own website. I just want to share what I have learned.</p>
<p>Anyway if you decide to build your website by yourself I wish you good luck and if you have any question please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me.</p>
