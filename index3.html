					<h2>What are Those Nice to Have Features?</h2>

 				<h2>Care - Best Marketing Strategy Ever</h2>	

				<div class="about-section">

				    <div class="left">					
				<p>My name is Josef. I live with my girlfriend in the mountains near Marshall, NC. I enjoy building great looking websites and I would like to offer you what I know about web design. I'd like to build a website which helps you to succeed in your business and bring new clients from the internet.</p>
				    </div>

				    <div class="right">
				    </div>

				</div>


 				<h2>What Do I Offer?</h2>	

		          <ul>
				<li>Great Looking Design - clean modern well organized website layout. The content of your website is the most important thing og your website. I'll try to keep the graphics elements decent so they don't distract your visitors. At the same time I'll make your website visually atractive and user friendly. </li>

				<li>Mobile Optimization - I'll make sure your website is showing correctly on all sizes of screen (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone). I'll test your website on the most popular internbet browsers to make sure it's showing correctly.</li>
				<li>On Site SEO Optimization - I'll do keyword research for your business (what phrasesr your customers most likely use when searching for your services)</li>
				<li></li>
			  </ul>
			

				<h2>What If You're Not from Asheville?</h2>

			<p>I've built websites for clients who I have never seen face to face. All communications were all trough phone and emails or Skype.

				<h2>Can I get My Website on Top Of The Results in Google?</h2>

			<p>Unfortunatelly it's not that simple. Your position in Google results depends on many factors as for exaple: how hard is the competition in your niche? Do you live in large city or in small town (large city - strong competion)? Are you able to write regularly artciles in your blog on your website?</p>

				<h2>What's is The Price?</h2>

			<p>My price for basic website starts at $750. I've built $300 websites in past but I realized that I can't put as much time into the development as I wanted to and therefore can't build the websites as good it could be. Building a good quality website takes time. So your website can benefit from it. 

Your website is not an expense. It's an investment to your business which makes you more money in the long run. 

				<h2>What is Web Design Process Like?</h2>

				

				<div class="testimonial">
				<p>"Josef was very helpful, creating a new website for me. I'm a counselor in Asheville and wanted to make my website more accessible. Josef was knowledgeable and answered all of my many questions. After the site was complete, I can't tell you how many times he answered my "final request." I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for quality, affordable web development."</p>
